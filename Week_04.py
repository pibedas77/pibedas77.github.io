# Tuesday: For Loops
# Loops are usefull to rerun the same lines of code several times.
# Lopps will always run untill a condition is met

for num in range(5):
    print("Value: {}".format(num))
# ! Range() function allows to count from one number to another.
# With in the function we are also able to define where to start and end and how much we increment or decrement

for num in range(2, 10, 2):
    print("Value: {}".format(num))

# Looping by element
# When working with data types that are iterable, we can use them in a for loop

name = "Mattia Pivetta"
for letter in name:
    print("Value: {}".format(letter))

# Continue statement
# Once a continue statement is hit, the current iteration stops and goes back to the top loop

for num in range(5):
    if num == 3:
        continue  # when num == 3, stop current iteratione and go back to the looping
    print(num)


# Break statement
# This is one of the most important statements. It allows us to break out of a loop at any point in time.
# This is usefull for stopping a loop when a condition is met
for num in range(5):
    if num == 3:
        break
    print("Value: {}".format(num))

# Pass statement
# Pass is a just a placeholder so that the program doesn't break
for i in range(5):
    # TO-DO: Add code to print
    pass

# Tuesday exercises
# 1. Divisible by Three

# Wednesday: While Loops
# While loops are generally used to loop based on a condition rather than counting
health = 10
while health > 0:
    print(health)

# Nested loops
for i in range(3):
